## About Me

I turn messy spreadsheets and disconnected data into clear, decision-ready insights.

As a data analyst with a background in marketing, I don’t just look at numbers—I look at what drives business.  
Whether it’s sales trends, customer behavior, or operational performance, I help teams see what matters, fast.

I work with tools that business leaders trust: **Power BI**, **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Python**.  
But tools are just tools. What sets me apart is how I connect the dots between data and decisions.

I also teach what I know through videos, 1-on-1 mentorship, and content viewed by **40,000+ learners**.

If you need insights, dashboards, or just a second brain to make sense of your data, I'm your person.
