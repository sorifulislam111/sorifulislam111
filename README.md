## About Me

With over 2 years of experience transforming data into actionable insights, I help decision-makers turn raw data into clear, impactful strategies using tools like Excel, Power BI, Python, and SQL.

Combining a strong foundation in statistics and marketing, I work at the intersection of analytical thinking and business impact. I also enjoy teaching core concepts of statistics and Excel through my YouTube channel and personal mentorship.
