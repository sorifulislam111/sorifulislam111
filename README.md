## About Me

I am a data analyst with a strong foundation in statistics, marketing, and business intelligence. My mission is to help decision-makers turn raw data into actionable insights using tools like Excel, Power BI, Python, and SQL.

With a background in marketing and a passion for data-driven strategy, I work at the intersection of analytical thinking and business impact. I also enjoy teaching core concepts of statistics and Excel through my YouTube channel and personal mentorship.
